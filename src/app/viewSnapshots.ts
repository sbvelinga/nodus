// What a section remembers when you leave it and come back.
//
// Changing `view` swaps the whole element at App.tsx's single render point, so React
// unmounts the previous section and every `useState` inside it dies. That is on
// purpose — the alternative, keeping sections mounted and hidden, would leave the
// heavy lists resident and their effects and timers alive. What it costs is the
// user's place: the filters, the ordering and the open tab all reset to their
// defaults, and returning to a section means rebuilding the cut of the corpus by
// hand.
//
// So the sections stay disposable and their *shape* is kept out here instead, above
// the render point, in a store that outlives them. This is the generalisation of
// what `toolkitPage` already does in App.tsx for the Toolkit's inner page.
//
// Three rules define what belongs in a snapshot:
//
//   1. A handful of values per view, not the whole state. What hurts to lose is the
//      cut: filters, ordering, the active tab. GlobalLibraryView alone holds 91
//      `useState` calls; 90 of them should die with the view.
//   2. Nothing ephemeral. Open modals, spinners, in-flight errors, unapplied input
//      drafts and export selections are gone on the way out, and should be.
//   3. Page and scroll are one value, never two. See `ListPlacement`.
//   4. Nothing that costs an action to restore. A snapshot puts the reader back
//      where they were; it does not re-run work on their behalf. This is why the
//      argument map's open tab is not kept: redrawing it means rebuilding it, and
//      in AI mode that would spend a model call for the act of entering a section.
//
// The store is deliberately NOT React state. It is read once when a view mounts and
// written on every filter change; as state it would re-render the whole shell on
// every keystroke in a search box, and this repo has paid for that before.
//
// All of this dies with the window, which is right for a place: on the next launch
// there is no "where was I". Three fields are not a place but a preference — the
// ordering, the read filter and grid-vs-list of the two galleries, set once and
// expected to hold — and those are written through to `filterPreferences` and read
// back as the seed a section mounts with. That file says why only those three.
