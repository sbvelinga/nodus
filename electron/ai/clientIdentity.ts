 * How Nodus identifies itself to third-party HTTP APIs.

 * `electron` here: this module is reached from `electron/ai/providers.ts`, which
 * the `node --test` harnesses bundle as an esbuild entry point, and there
 * `electron` resolves to a path string with no `app` on it. Hard-coding the
 * number is not an option either — `libraryCslStyles.ts` announced `Nodus/4.2.3`
 * to GitHub for eleven releases because the string was typed in by hand.

 * all three protocols plus the unauthenticated catalogue call in Settings.
 *
 * Nodus has no chat conversations, so the closest equivalent is a unit of work:
 * one deep scan of a work, one Deep Research report, one Nodi thread. Job ids are
 * shaped `<root>:<stage>:<chunk>…`, so the root is what groups a run's many
 * chunked calls under a single session; calls with no job id share one id for the
 * running process.
 *
 * What travels is always a fresh random UUID, never the job id itself: job ids are
 * content-free but they still spell out which Nodus pipeline is running, and that
 * is not OpenCode's business. Nothing is persisted, so no id survives a restart
 * and none can act as a stable identifier for the user.
