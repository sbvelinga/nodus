# Nodus third-party notices

Nodus 5.2.1 is free software distributed exclusively under the GNU Affero
General Public License v3.0 (`AGPL-3.0-only`). Versions through 3.2.7 remain
available under MIT. Nodus includes or interoperates with the components and
data described below. Those components keep their own licenses and their
authors do not endorse Nodus.

Every packaged application also contains a `legal` directory next to its
resources with:

- the complete Nodus AGPL license and Corresponding Source offer;
- the complete, generated license inventory for the exact production packages;
- the upstream ONNX Runtime and sharp/libvips third-party notices;
- the Electron and Chromium license collections;
- the GNU GPL/LGPL and Creative Commons license texts; and
- instructions and source references for replacing/rebuilding LGPL components.

## GeoNames geographical data — CC BY 4.0

The offline gazetteer in Nodus is derived from the GeoNames `cities15000`,
`admin1CodesASCII` and `countryInfo` datasets.

- Creator: GeoNames (https://www.geonames.org/)
- Source: https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/
- License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
  (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
- Changes made by Nodus: records are filtered to the `cities15000` dataset,
  joined with country and first-level administrative names, reduced to the
  fields used by the place picker, sorted by population, converted to TSV and
  compressed with gzip.

GeoNames data is provided "as is" and without endorsement. A complete copy of
CC BY 4.0 is included in `legal/generated/CC-BY-4.0.txt`.

## Multilingual E5 small model — MIT

Nodus for Zotero downloads and runs the quantized ONNX weights from
`Xenova/multilingual-e5-small`, pinned to revision
`761b726dd34fb83930e26aab4e9ac3899aa1fa78`. That repository is an ONNX
conversion of `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small`; the base model is licensed
under the MIT License.

## Transformers.js — Apache License 2.0

Nodus bundles Transformers.js 3.8.1 to run the local Zotero embedding model.
Transformers.js is copyright Hugging Face and contributors and is licensed
under the Apache License 2.0. Its license text is included in the generated
third-party license bundle.

## ONNX Runtime — MIT

Nodus uses ONNX Runtime 1.18.0, 1.21.0 and the development build identified by
commit `89f8206ba4f1c22c39e0297fb55272e8ce8cd7d0`, through Transformers.js and
VITS Web. Copyright Microsoft Corporation. ONNX Runtime is licensed under MIT.

The full MIT license and the version-specific upstream third-party notices are
included in `legal/generated/`.

## LGPL components

Nodus uses the following unmodified LGPL components:

- `libheif-js` 1.19.8 / libheif, used for HEIC decoding, LGPL-3.0;
- the shared libraries supplied by `@img/sharp-libvips-*` 1.2.4, including
  libvips 8.17.3 and other LGPL libraries listed by the upstream package.

These libraries remain under the GNU LGPL; Nodus does not impose restrictions
on reverse engineering for debugging modifications to them. The full GPL and
LGPL texts, upstream notices, exact source references and replacement/build
instructions are in `legal/LGPL_COMPLIANCE.md` and `legal/generated/`.

## Managed AI runtimes

Nodus redistributes the following official, unmodified runtimes as optional
parts of its AI-provider integration:

- OpenAI Codex CLI (`@openai/codex` 0.144.6), Apache License 2.0;
- GitHub Copilot SDK (`@github/copilot-sdk` 1.0.7), MIT License;
- GitHub Copilot CLI (`@github/copilot` 1.0.71), under the GitHub Copilot CLI
  License distributed with the application.

Nodus is independently licensed. OpenAI, ChatGPT, Codex, GitHub and Copilot are
trademarks of their respective owners. Inclusion does not imply affiliation,
certification or endorsement.

## Zotero mark

The Zotero “Z” shown in the in-app tutorial is the official symbolic icon from
the Zotero source distribution:
https://github.com/zotero/zotero/blob/main/app/linux/icons/symbolic.svg

Zotero is developed by the Corporation for Digital Scholarship. Zotero and its
logo are trademarks of the Corporation for Digital Scholarship. Nodus is an
independent project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Zotero.

## Engines downloaded at runtime

The local model installer downloads the unmodified `llama.cpp` release b10002
directly from its GitHub release. llama.cpp is MIT licensed and its source is:
https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/b10002

The local image model installer downloads the unmodified `stable-diffusion.cpp`
release `master-782-b290693` directly from its GitHub release. The runtime and
its bundled ggml component are MIT licensed; license texts are included in the
downloaded archive and the corresponding source is:
https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp/tree/b290693

Piper speech downloads `@diffusionstudio/piper-wasm` 1.0.0 from jsDelivr when
the user first invokes it. That runtime incorporates eSpeak NG, licensed under
GPL-3.0-or-later. Nodus is AGPL/GPL-compatible free software and imposes no
additional restriction on that component. The GPL text is included in
`legal/generated/GPL-3.0.txt`; source and build information are available at:

- https://github.com/diffusion-studio/piper-wasm/tree/69522c832bd52d7c16389e9a8aee568065027689
- https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng

## Downloadable models and voices

Model weights are not included in the Nodus installer. When the user requests
one, Nodus downloads it directly from its named upstream repository. The model
picker displays its source and license before download.

The optional native image pipeline downloads FLUX.2 [klein] 4B Q4 weights, its
Qwen3 4B Q4 text encoder and the FLUX.2 VAE. These components are Apache-2.0;
Nodus also downloads the upstream license texts next to the weights. This
integration intentionally uses the 4B model. The similarly named 9B model is
subject to the separate FLUX Non-Commercial License and is not downloaded by
Nodus. Sources:

- https://huggingface.co/leejet/FLUX.2-klein-4B-GGUF
- https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B
- https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-GGUF
- https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B

Nodus is free and open-source software. Some optional Piper
voice datasets, including HFC Female and Ryan, are marked CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and
must not be reused for commercial purposes. LFM2.5 is governed by the LFM Open
License v1.0, which contains a separate condition for legal entities with at
least USD 10 million in annual revenue. Users remain responsible for uses
outside the license terms of those optional datasets.

## IDprotector v0.4.1 — MIT

Nodus Protect contains a maintainable TypeScript port of algorithms and
behaviour from IDprotector 0.4.1:
